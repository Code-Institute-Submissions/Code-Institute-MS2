This is a website for a random trivia quiz using the jService api. Designed to be eye-catching, responsive & accessible on different devices.

## User Experience

### User Stories

- First Time Visitor
    - When I visit this site I want to understand what the site does and how I can interact with it.
    - I would also like to be able to navigate through the site and interact with it easily.
- Returning Visitor
    - As a returning visitor I may be looking to improve my score in the quiz to see if I can get further.
- Frequent User
    - As a frequent user I would be consistently be looking to improve my score in the quiz.

### Design

- Color Scheme
    - Will likely be tied to whatever picture I can find for my quiz guy.

- Typography
    - Montserrat?
- Imagery
    - I think having images of people using the gym is a useful way to show the equipment available but also to make the website more appealing.

- Wireframes
    - I created Wireframes for various extra pages such as membership forms and an about us page. However, these extra pages and are not core to the design of the website so are not included.

            1. Quiz format itself.

## Features

- The website should be responsive across different devices. (hopefully)
- The website should also be extremely interactive and user friendly. (Using the string similarity api to make the quiz answers friendly)

### Taking The Project Further

If I were taking the project further there are some features I believe would benefit the website and add more functionality to it:
- History of the users scores ie. a leaderboard. (Local or global?)
- Possibliy being able to choose a topic for the questions? or having different leaderboards for differetn categories.
